## About iTrustCapital IRAs

iTrustCapital makes it easy to open an IRA that allows you to invest in a full suite of cryptocurrencies and physical precious metals for your retirement.

With iTrustCapital, you can transfer your existing IRA or start a new one, or rollover your 401K, TSP, 403(b), 457, and more.

All iTrustCapital accounts are IRAs, which shelter transactions within the account from any taxes, so that your gains are either tax-deferred or tax-free, depending on the type of IRA you have.

To fund your new iTrustCapital IRA, you can rollover old employer plans, contribute via ACH bank transfers, or transfer an existing IRA, and iTrustCapital also offers In-Kind Transfers for Crypto IRAs to make switching to iTrustCapital easy.

The minimum to open an iTrustCapital account is $1,000, and the maximum to fund an account is based on IRS limitations for cash contributions, but there is no maximum for IRA Transfers or Qualified Plan Rollovers.

Once you open your iTrustCapital IRA, you’ll have 24/7 access to every asset offered on the platform, including multiple cryptocurrencies, gold, and silver, and with Conditional Transactions, you can schedule your self-trading to occur automatically at certain prices.

There are no monthly account fees, and transfer fees are as follows: 1% for cryptocurrency transactions; $50 over spot per ounce for physical gold; and $2.50 over spot per ounce for physical silver.

There is a 1-time fee of $75 to convert a Traditional IRA or SEP IRA to a Roth IRA, and this conversion will incur a taxable event.

iTrustCapital provides you with all necessary IRA/tax reporting requirements as well as unlimited storage with institutional custody partners, plus their support team is available to help you with whatever you may need.

Get a $100 sign-up bonus when you open and fund a new IRA with iTrustCapital, plus earn extra $100 rewards for sharing iTrustCapital referrals.
